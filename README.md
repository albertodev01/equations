The `equations` package is written purely in Dart and helps you solve equations. Whether you're building a CLI application, a web server or a cross-platform Flutter project, `equations` has you covered. Here's what you can do with this :

  - solve polynomial equations and inequalities with `Algebraic` types;
  - solve nonlinear equations with `Nonlinear` types;
  - solve linear systems of equations with `SystemSolver` types;

In addition, you can also find utilities to work with:

  - real and complex matrices, using the `RealMatrix` and `ComplexMatrix` types;
  - complex numbers, using the `Complex` type;
  - integral evaluation, with `NumericalIntegration` types;
  - data interpolation, with `Interpolation` types.

The website hosted at this repository's <a href="https://albertodev01.github.io/equations/">GitHub Pages</a> contains the latest `dart doc` HTML documentation. For more information about solving equations and examples on how to use the classes from this package, check out the articles on the Wiki pages:
