/// The so called "**root-finding algorithms**" are iterative methods that start
/// from an initial value (or a couple of values) and try to build a scalar
/// succession that converges as much as possible to the root. The algorithms
/// implemented by this package are:
///
///   - [Bisection]
///   - [Chords]
///   - [Newton]
///   - [Secant]
///   - [Steffensen]
///   - [Brent]
///   - [RegulaFalsi]
///   - [Riddler]

/// Each subclass of [NonLinear] has to override the [solve] method to build the
/// scalar succession with a certain logic. It's expected to produce a series
/// of values that progressively get closer to the real root.
