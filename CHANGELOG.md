## 4.0.0
 - **BREAKING**: The `Complex.fromPolar` constructor now asks for required **named** parameters
 - **BREAKING**: The `Interpolation` constructor now asks for required **named** parameters
 - **BREAKING**: The `SylvesterMatrix` type now accepts an `Algebraic` type rather than a `List<Complex>`. As such, the `SylvesterMatrix.fromReal` constructor has been removed because a real polynomial can be built using `Algebraic.fromReal` instead
 - **BREAKING**: The `SystemSolver` type now accepts a `RealMatrix` type rather than a `List<List<double>>`. As such, the `size` parameter has also been removed because the size can be retrieved from the `RealMatrix` object itself
 - **BREAKING**: New names for `SytemSolver` parameters: changes `equations` to `matrix` and `constants` to `knownValues`
 - Updated Dart SDK constraints to `">=2.17.0 <3.0.0"`
 - Added `csc` (cosecant) and `sec` (secant) trigonometric functions to the `ExpressionParser` type
 - Migrated Dart code to 2.17 with super parameters

## 3.0.0
 - **BREAKING**: Replaced the `Laguerre` type with `DurandKerner` (the latter is a more reliable root-finding algorithm for polynomials)
 - **BREAKING**: Removed the `integrateOn` method on `Nonlinear`. Now numerical integration algorithms live on their own in the `src/integral` folder
 - **BREAKING**: renamed `firstGuess` and `secondGuess` to `a` and `b` respectively in `Secant` (for consistency with other `Nonlinear` types)
