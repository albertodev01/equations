# Examples

This folder contains some examples to show how the `equations` package could be used. In particular:

  - the `dart_example/` folder contains a Dart CLI app that uses the `equations` package;
  - the `flutter_example/` folder contains a Flutter app that uses the `equations` package.

You can also play with the Flutter example online at [https://albertodev01.github.io/equations/](https://albertodev01.github.io/equations/).
